# .dotfiles

The best way to deploy these configuration files is to find where they are
supposed to live on your system and to delete the original (if it already
exists) and to create a symlink in its place which points to corresponding
configuration file/directory within `.dotfiles` wherever it happens to be
cloned.

## Locations
